# Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout

Work in progress 

A repository I originally made in order to backup and restore my Hyprland config easily, made for AZERTY keyboard users.

It offers :
- Keybindings made for AZERTY
- Zsh config
- Waybar config
- Already configured hyprland.conf

The config is cut in two scripts :
- install.sh :
  Setups hyprland and zsh

- extra-packages.sh :
  Installs additional packages

# Installation :

If you want the latest version :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Susheate/Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout.git && cd Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout && sh install.sh
```

If you want a fully tested version, use the releases.
