# Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout

Work in progress 

A repository I originally made in order to backup and restore my Hyprland config easily, made for AZERTY keyboard users.

It offers :
- Keybindings made for AZERTY
- Zsh config (Oh My Zsh, Starship)
- Fastfetch config
- Waybar config
- Already configured hyprland.conf (Custom keybindings, display resolution...)
- Fix for OBS on Hyprland

This collection of config files can be used as it is or as a base for further configuration.

# Installation :

If you want the latest version :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Susheate/Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout.git && cd Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout && sh install.sh
```

If you want a fully tested version, use the releases.
