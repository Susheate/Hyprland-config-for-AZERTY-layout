# Hyprland-config-for-AZERTY-layout
A Hyprland dotfile made for AZERTY keyboard users


A config I originally made in order to backup and restore my Hyprland config easily, made for AZERTY keyboard users.
Cut in two scripts :
- install.sh :
  Setups hyprland and zsh

- extra-packages.sh :
  Installs the packages I need
